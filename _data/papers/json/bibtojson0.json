Programmers and musicians prefer a custom-tailored environment where their high-level ideas can be better expressed and implemented thanks to specific domain knowledge. In particular, strongly typed functional programming has become an ideal platform for audio programming, thanks to a concise, high-level writing style, high reusability, and ability to avoid mistakes and improve error handling. - How may Web Audio benefit from these ideas? - How may such languages benefit from Web Audio? In this talk, we will use the functional audio programming language Faust as the reference DSL, to discuss a formal theory of interoperable and efficient audio components. Particular emphasis will be made on the use of strong, functional-style type-systems. We will address performance, security, and practical considerations, and reflect on the relationship of such theoretical framework to the actual standard.","ADDRESS":"Paris","BOOKTITLE":"Proceedings of the International Web Audio Conference","EDITOR":"Goldszmidt, Samuel and Schnell, Norbert and Saiz, Victor and Matuszewski, Benjamin","FILE":":Users/Hjem/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/85dca677d30c78960440344f9ddaa9b039230601.html:html","PUBLISHER":"IRCAM","SERIES":"WAC '15","TYPE":"Talk","URL":"https://medias.ircam.fr/x396729"},{"key":"2015_vid1","type":"misc","AUTHOR":"Vinet, Hugues and Schnell, Norbert and Goldszmidt, Samuel","TITLE":"WAC 2015 Introduction","MONTH":"January","YEAR":"2015","ABSTRACT":"Web Audio Conference 2015 Introduction","ADDRESS":"Paris","BOOKTITLE":"Proceedings of the International Web Audio Conference","EDITOR":"Goldszmidt, Samuel and Schnell, Norbert and Saiz, Victor and Matuszewski, Benjamin","FILE":":Users/Hjem/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/4d334ebf9f2b4800ad2e49dba876fa71ac0ae028.html:html","PUBLISHER":"IRCAM","SERIES":"WAC '15","TYPE":"Talk","URL":"https://medias.ircam.fr/x4116d0"},{"key":"2015_vid3","type":"misc","AUTHOR":"Santell, Jordan","TITLE":"Web Audio Tools","MONTH":"January","YEAR":"2015","ABSTRACT":"As technologies evolve and mature, proper tooling is needed to increase adoption and combat complexity. Web audio is no exception. An overture on the state of web audio tools, we will explore using both browser developer tools that take advantage of privileged platform code, and cross-browser drop-in libraries to provide introspection of the state of an audio context and nodes. With these tools, we'll cover common debugging scenarios like audio graph construction, node-to-node signal transformations, signal visualizations, garbage collection, and resource consumption. These tools can help beginners understand a complex new API, save a developer's time debugging, and help browser implementers optimize their platform. Attendees will leave with the knowledge of what tools are out there, workflows for inspecting, fixing, and optimizing a web audio environment, and how to make their own tools for a specific use case.","ADDRESS":"Paris","BOOKTITLE":"Proceedings of the International Web Audio Conference","EDITOR":"Goldszmidt, Samuel and Schnell, Norbert and Saiz, Victor and Matuszewski, Benjamin","FILE":":Users/Hjem/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/73f411709764f7a6c267e0cc65489ea0f4c5171e.html:html","PUBLISHER":"IRCAM","SERIES":"WAC '15","TYPE":"Talk","URL":"https://medias.ircam.fr/x32ba00"},{"key":"2015_vid2","type":"misc","AUTHOR":"Monschke, Jan","TITLE":"Building a Collaborative Digital Audio Workstation Based on the Web Audio API","MONTH":"January","YEAR":"2015","ABSTRACT":"The introduction of the Web Audio API has enriched the web landscape enormously. It gives game developers the ability to add precisely timed, high performant sound effects and to create realistic spatialized sound landscapes. For many web developers it is the first time they encounter audio programming which leads to many interesting experiments when the world of web and audio collide. Traditional web developers start to become really interested in audio programming and educate themselves on the topic of synthesizers and audio effects. However, currently there are only few applications that try to create more sophisticates audio production tools in the browser. In this talk I want to show how I used the Web Audio API and other emerging web standards like WebRTC to create a collaborative digital audio workstation.

Similarly, \"parallel computers\" were locked in research facilities, where only a few musicians ever gained access to, for example, the compute power to convolve hundreds of separate audio streams with spatially- specific room impulse responses. Mobile devices in the hands of audiences can quickly configure themselves into such systems at very affordable (and distributed) cost and little effort, making powerful and expressive spatially distributed musical platforms accessible to anyone today.

The majority of such listening tests is conducted in controlled environments with selected participants and professional audio equipment. In the last few years, conducting listening tests over the Internet, as so called web-based experiments, has become popular. A recent study has shown that web-based experiments lead to comparable results as laboratory experiments. Until now, it was only possible to implement a limited number of listening test types as web-based experiments because web standards were missing some crucial features, e. g. sample manipulation of audio streams. With the upcoming of the Web Audio API, a much wider range of listening test types can be implemented as new audio processing features have been introduced. This paper demonstrates which new possibilities are enabled by the Web Audio API. To this end, the ITU-R Recommendation BS.1534 (MUSHRA) is taken as an example.","FILE":":Users/Hjem/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Schoeffler et al. - 2015 - Towards the Next Generation of Web-based Experiments A Case Study Assessing Basic Audio Quality Following the.pdf:pdf","ISSN":"2663-5844","KEYWORDS":"1534,itu-r recommendation bs,mushra,web-based ex-","TYPE":"Paper","URL":"https://medias.ircam.fr/x5feecb"},{"key":"2015_EA_13","type":"inproceedings","AUTHOR":"Pendharkar, Chinmay and B√§ck, Peter and Wyse, Lonce","TITLE":"A Dynamic Audio Experience creation platform in Web Audio","BOOKTITLE":"Proceedings of the International Web Audio Conference","YEAR":"2015","EDITOR":"Goldszmidt, Samuel and Schnell, Norbert and Saiz, Victor and Matuszewski, Benjamin","SERIES":"WAC '15","ADDRESS":"Paris","MONTH":"January","PUBLISHER":"IRCAM","ABSTRACT":"This paper describes innovative aspects of the Sonoport Studio, a dynamic audio experience creation platform which will be presented in a demonstration at the 1st Web Audio Conference in Paris.

Sonic source material comes from a database of birdsongs recorded worldwide by volunteer recordists at xeno-canto.org. Sounds from xeno-canto are chosen to match recent, nearby bird sightings submitted by volunteer birders at eBird. The result is a virtual soundscape derived from the sounds of birds currently present in the user's geographical region. Our client-server architecture delegates database queries and archival storage to the server, leaving the client to concentrate on the aesthetic context of sound modification and manipulation. Engineering issues include separation of client versus server concerns and mashups of crowdsourced databases. Aesthetic issues include which tasks are automated server-side, which are user-controlled client-side, and why. Social issues include single user versus multiple user paradigms, artistic soundscape composition versus commercial applications (e.g., games with evolving sound tracks) using public domain sound sources, music as foreground art versus background audio content, and the larger role of sound and music in current society.

The soundscape simulator allows a subject to generate a full sonic environment by sequencing and mixing sound elements , and manipulating their sound level and time positioning. To make the simulation process effective, SimScene has not be designed to manipulate individual parameters of individual sounds, but to specify high-level parameters for whole classes of sounds, organized into a hierarchical semantically structured dataset. To avoid any linguistic bias, a listening oriented interface allows subjects to explore the dataset without any text written help. The entire software is developed in Javascript using the standard Web Audio technology , and is thus fully supported by most modern web browsers. This fact should allow experimenters to adopt a crowdsourcing approach to experimentation in order to assess hypotheses on large populations, and facilitate the development of experimental protocols to investigate the influence of socio-cultural background on soundscape perception.","FILE":":Users/Hjem/Downloads/drive-download-20190915T212022Z-001/2015/posters/wac15_submission_31.pdf:pdf","KEYWORDS":"H55 [Sound and Music Computing]: Signal analysis,Human Factors Keywords sound perception,Simulation,and processing General Terms Audio,cognitive psychology,soundscape,synthesis,web-based acoustic scenes sim-ulator,web-based sound environment generator,web-based soundscape simulator","TYPE":"Poster"},{"key":"2015_19","type":"inproceedings","AUTHOR":"Schnell, Norbert and Saiz, Victor and Barkati, Karim and Goldszmidt, Samuel","TITLE":"Of Time Engines and Masters - An API for Scheduling and Synchronizing the Generation and Playback of Event Sequences and Media Streams for the Web Audio API","BOOKTITLE":"Proceedings of the International Web Audio Conference","YEAR":"2015","EDITOR":"Goldszmidt, Samuel and Schnell, Norbert and Saiz, Victor and Matuszewski, Benjamin","VOLUME":"i","SERIES":"WAC '15","ADDRESS":"Paris","MONTH":"January","PUBLISHER":"IRCAM","ABSTRACT":"In this article we present an API and a set of Javascript modules for the synchronized scheduling and aligned playback of predetermined sequences of events such as notes, audio segments, and parameter changes as well as media streams (e.g. audio buffers) based on the Web Audio API logical time.

Dynamic range control applied by the broadcaster can go some way to avoiding problems but, because the broadcaster cannot take into account each listener's individual environment, needs, or preference, it cannot please everyone all the time. The listening conditions are a significant factor to be taken into account when dynamic range control is applied. The Web Audio API offers the possibility of performing dynamic range control under the control of the listener, tailoring it optimally for their individual situation. We have developed a system that demonstrates that this is achievable in a modern web browser. In it, a compressor is controlled automatically by the environmental noise level measured using the microphone present in most mobile device audio players.","FILE":":Users/Hjem/Downloads/drive-download-20190915T212022Z-001/2015/posters/wac15_submission_25.pdf:pdf","KEYWORDS":"broadcasting,object based audio,web audio api","TYPE":"Poster"},{"key":"2015_EA_20","type":"inproceedings","AUTHOR":"Burleigh, Ian G. and Schaller, Thilo","TITLE":"Quint.js: A JavaScript library for teaching music technology to fine arts students","BOOKTITLE":"Proceedings of the International Web Audio Conference","YEAR":"2015","EDITOR":"Goldszmidt, Samuel and Schnell, Norbert and Saiz, Victor and Matuszewski, Benjamin","VOLUME":"i","NUMBER":"September","SERIES":"WAC '15","ADDRESS":"Paris","MONTH":"January","PUBLISHER":"IRCAM","ABSTRACT":"This paper presents quint.js, a JavaScript library for making interactive HTML/SVG/Web Audio ‚Äúapplets‚Äù.
