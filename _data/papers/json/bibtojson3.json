Latency makes it difficult to write software that properly synchronizes computer audio with “real world” audio and interactions. In many situations, Web Audio apps have to deal with huge amounts of latency. Humans have issues with timing too: it's often hard for us to perform actions perfectly on rhythm or in synchrony with our computer's understanding of time. In this talk, I'll detail the techniques I used to develop a live-looping app using Web Audio, including methods for measuring and handling various types of latency and structuring code to avoid spreading latency-handling logic throughout the application. I'll also discuss features that help humans more easily express timing in music, like allowing a loop to start before the “record” button was pressed and implementing button press “fudging” that starts, stops, and records loops at the time the performer meant to press the button, not the time they actually pressed the button.","ADDRESS":"Berlin","BOOKTITLE":"Proceedings of the International Web Audio Conference","EDITOR":"Monschke, Jan and Guttandin, Christoph and Schnell, Norbert and Jenkinson, Thomas and Schaedler, Jack","PUBLISHER":"TU Berlin","SERIES":"WAC '18","TYPE":"Talk","URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-rR1y8zu3M"},{"key":"2018_KN2","type":"misc","AUTHOR":"Rogers, Chris","TITLE":"The second keynote of WAC 2018","MONTH":"September","YEAR":"2018","ABSTRACT":"Chris Rogers is a software architect, specializing in audio production tools and music applications.

Hybrid forms where DSP algorithms are implemented in both JavaScript and native C++, and distributed forms where web technologies are used only for the user interface, are also supported. Various implementation options are explored, and the most promising option is implemented and evaluated. We found that the solution is able to operate at 128 sample buffer sizes, and that the performance of the Web Audio API audio graph is not compromised. The proof-of-concept solution also maintains compatibility with existing Web Audio API implementations. The average MIDI latency was 24 ms, which is high when comparing with fully native plugin solutions. Backwards compatibility also reduces usability when working with multiple plugin instances. We conclude that the second iteration needs to break backwards compatibility in order to overcome the MIDI latency and multi-plugin support issues.","FILE":":Users/Hjem/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Kleimola, Campbell - 2018 - Native Web Audio API Plugins.pdf:pdf","TYPE":"Paper","URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kpv6_EU9YmE"},{"key":"2018_4","type":"inproceedings","AUTHOR":"Thalmann, Florian and Thompson, Lucas and Sandler, Mark","TITLE":"A User-Adaptive Automated DJ Web App with Object-Based Audio and Crowd-Sourced Decision Trees","BOOKTITLE":"Proceedings of the International Web Audio Conference","YEAR":"2018","EDITOR":"Monschke, Jan and Guttandin, Christoph and Schnell, Norbert and Jenkinson, Thomas and Schaedler, Jack","VOLUME":"c","SERIES":"WAC '18","ADDRESS":"Berlin","MONTH":"September","PUBLISHER":"TU Berlin","ABSTRACT":"We describe the concepts behind a web-based minimal-UI DJ system that adapts to the user's preference via simple interactive decisions and feedback on taste.

Although the APIs are different, all exist to achieve more or less the same thing - represent an instrument or audio effect and allow it to be loaded by a host application. In the Web Audio API such a high-level audio plug-in entity does not exist. With the emergence of web-based audio software such as digital audio workstations (DAWs), it is desirable to have a standard in order to make Web Audio instruments and effects interoperable. Since there are many ways of developing for Web Audio, such a standard should be flexible enough to support different approaches, including using a variety of programming languages. New functionality that is enabled by the web platform should be available to plug-ins written in different ways. To this end, several groups of developers came together to make their work compatible, and this paper presents the work achieved so far. This includes the development of a draft API specification, a small preliminary SDK, online plug-in validators and a set of examples written in JavaScript. These simple, proof of concept examples show how to discover plug-ins from repositories, how to instantiate a plug-in and how to connect plug-ins together. A more ambitious host has also been developed to validate the WAP standard: a virtual guitar “pedal board” that discovers plug-ins from multiple remote repositories, and allows the musician to chain pedals and control them via MIDI.","FILE":":Users/Hjem/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Buffa et al. - 2018 - WAP Ideas for a Web Audio Plug-in Standard.pdf:pdf","TYPE":"Paper","URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D5aQozfxvI"},{"key":"2018_3","type":"inproceedings","AUTHOR":"Carson, Tate","TITLE":"A more perfect union: Composition with audience-controlled smartphone speaker array and evolutionary computer music","BOOKTITLE":"Proceedings of the International Web Audio Conference","YEAR":"2018","EDITOR":"Monschke, Jan and Guttandin, Christoph and Schnell, Norbert and Jenkinson, Thomas and Schaedler, Jack","SERIES":"WAC '18","ADDRESS":"Berlin","MONTH":"September","PUBLISHER":"TU Berlin","ABSTRACT":"A more perfect union incorporates an audience-controlled smartphone speaker array with evolutionary computer music.

As a coding artist, I try to mould the Web Audio API into actionable music tools. Therefore, I started to translate the Tone.js Framework into a Ruby gem. 2. I try to find a balance between the coding part and my ‘normal' music workflow, i.e. sketching ideas with the intuitive user interface of professional DAW software, in my case: Ableton Live. Therefore I need to find an easy way to transfer musical content between the Ableton and the Web Audio environments. 3.

This paper details an event I developed in collaboration with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, chef David Verdo, and designer Jutta Friedrichs that took place on January 5 and 7, 2017. Cena concertante alla maniera di Vivaldi was a four-course meal with real- time musical accompaniment deployed from a seventy-channel speaker array comprised of sixty-four iPads and six near field studio monitors, all coordinated via the same network. The iPads were positioned in custom-built acoustic resonators placed at each seat in the restaurant, presenting a unique audio channel to each diner, synchronized to the rhythms of each diner's meal and sited as close as possible to the food. The music was based on Vivaldi's Piccolo Concerto in C Major, RV 443, drawing from archival BSO performances, with the objective of enhancing diners' appreciation of a live performance of the work on a concert following the meal. The menu was based on the music, drawing on research in the field of crossmodal psychology that identifies links between the senses of taste and hearing. This paper discusses the background of the project, its musical organization, the infrastructure and control techniques required to execute it, and relevant research in the field of crossmodal psychology, concluding with a discussion of areas for future work.","FILE":":Users/Hjem/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Houge - 2018 - Cena concertante alla maniera di Vivaldi Considering the Restaurant as a Musical Interface.pdf:pdf","TYPE":"Paper"},{"key":"2018_24","type":"inproceedings","AUTHOR":"Yi, Steven and Lazzarini, Victor and Costello, Ed","TITLE":"WebAssembly AudioWorklet Csound","BOOKTITLE":"Proceedings of the International Web Audio Conference","YEAR":"2018","EDITOR":"Monschke, Jan and Guttandin, Christoph and Schnell, Norbert and Jenkinson, Thomas and Schaedler, Jack","SERIES":"WAC '18","ADDRESS":"Berlin","MONTH":"September","PUBLISHER":"TU Berlin","ABSTRACT":"This paper describes WebAssembly AudioWorklet (WAAW) Csound, one of the implementations of Web Audio Csound.

SoundSling adapts dynamically to the total number of devices as users connect to or disconnect from the network. This helps to ensure that the performer's chosen diffusion patterns and motion trajectories can be scaled properly to the array of currently-participating devices.

The project also touches on issues of unreliability of Bluetooth tracking indoors, the state of BLE-based project development, and the need for Web Bluetooth development to enable these types of projects.","FILE":":Users/Hjem/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Mitchusson, Allison - 2018 - Lost In Space Indoor Localization for Virtual Environment Exploration.pdf:pdf","TYPE":"Paper"},{"key":"2018_vid10","type":"misc","AUTHOR":"Parviainen, Tero","TITLE":"Musical Deep Neural Networks in the Browser","MONTH":"September","YEAR":"2018","ABSTRACT":"2018 is the year deep neural networks have arrived in the web browser. This development has many exciting prospects. One of them is that all the work AI researchers have put into musical applications of neural nets is suddenly available to use in web apps. We can now use generative musical deep learning models and build interactive web-based experiences on top of them, with the help of Web Audio and the rest of the web platform. In this talk I will present some recent experiments I've made using deep neural nets and Web Audio in the browser. They're mostly based on Google's Magenta.js library and neural net models trained by the Magenta team. We'll see how recurrent neural networks can be used to build melodic “autocompletion” tools and arpeggiators, as well as generative drum patterns. We'll also see how to use variational autoencoder models to explore latent musical spaces: Interpolating between melodies, and exploring musical generative space with vector arithmetic.","ADDRESS":"Berlin","BOOKTITLE":"Proceedings of the International Web Audio Conference","EDITOR":"Monschke, Jan and Guttandin, Christoph and Schnell, Norbert and Jenkinson, Thomas and Schaedler, Jack","PUBLISHER":"TU Berlin","SERIES":"WAC '18","TYPE":"Talk","URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKRJuz6o2uY"},{"key":"2018_vid13","type":"misc","AUTHOR":"Guttandin, Christoph","TITLE":"The Timing Object - A Pacemaker for the Web","MONTH":"September","YEAR":"2018","ABSTRACT":"The web knows many different timing mechanisms which all have their unique use case. Unfortunately there is no easy way to align any of those timers. They often have their own timeline, unit and level of accuracy. How would you for example synchronize a slide show on a beamer with the audio recording of the speaker played back on a different device? The Timing Object is aiming to solve that problem. It is a W3C Draft which introduces yet another timing mechanism. But it is completely unopinionated about what it controls. It is specifically designed to control multiple timed sources in sync. Sadly the Timing Object hasn't gained much traction so far. No browser vendor has implemented it yet or is currently planning to do so. The specification process itself seems to be slowing down as well. But that doesn't have to be the end of the story. The Timing Object can mostly be implemented in user land and some parts of the spec are purposefully incomplete to allow different implementations by third party vendors. I want to show what is already possible and how everybody can start using the Timing Object right now in their applications. As many of the presentations and demos at previous WACs have shown, many people have built their own custom solution to realize distributed synchronization. I hope to raise interest in the Timing Object Draft and motivate more people to contribute their experience to the standardization process. One of the things which is meant to be implemented by third party vendors is the TimingProvider. The TimingProvider is responsible for synchronizing Timing Objects across different devices. I want to demonstrate the usage of a TimingProvider which uses WebRTC internally to setup the communication between participating devices. There are of course also some parts of the specification which have to be build by browser vendors. But I'm sure that if the Timing Object gets used in the wild the browser vendors will eventually start to implement it natively.","ADDRESS":"Berlin","BOOKTITLE":"Proceedings of the International Web Audio Conference","EDITOR":"Monschke, Jan and Guttandin, Christoph and Schnell, Norbert and Jenkinson, Thomas and Schaedler, Jack","FILE":":Users/Hjem/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/d50cc9562f6d6511a3d1d0360bf0efd769648310.html:html","PUBLISHER":"TU Berlin","SERIES":"WAC '18","TYPE":"Talk","URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xqVzTIVEB4"},{"key":"2018_7","type":"inproceedings","AUTHOR":"Sarwate, Avneesh and Tsuchiya, Takahiko and Freeman, Jason","TITLE":"Collaborative Coding with Music: Two Case Studies with EarSketch","BOOKTITLE":"Proceedings of the International Web Audio Conference","YEAR":"2018","EDITOR":"Monschke, Jan and Guttandin, Christoph and Schnell, Norbert and Jenkinson, Thomas and Schaedler, Jack","SERIES":"WAC '18","ADDRESS":"Berlin","MONTH":"September","PUBLISHER":"TU Berlin","ABSTRACT":"This paper describes the motivation, design, and implementation of new features in EarSketch that enable the collaborative creation of algorithmic music.

The framework includes functionality for the creation, connection and management of processing units, runtime profiling, buffer management, buffer conversion and a configurable build system. The proposed three-step development of a signal processor with DSP2JS allows for external libraries to be included, making it possible to port existing code to the framework. The generated artifacts can then be used in a web page and invoked via an interface similar to native WebAudio-Nodes.

Tools such as wavesurfer.js, waveform-playlist and trackswitch.js provide highly-configurable players, allowing a more interactive exploration of scientific results that goes beyond simple linear playback. However, the audio output to be presented is in many cases not generated by the same web technologies. The process of preparing audio data for display therefore requires manual intervention, in order to bridge the resulting gap between programming languages. While this is acceptable for one-time events, such as the preparation of final results, it prevents the usage of such players during the iterative development cycle. Having access to rich audio players already during development would allow researchers to get more instantaneous feedback. The current workflow consists of repeatedly importing audio into a digital audio workstation in order to achieve similar capabilities, a repetitive and time-consuming process. In order to address these needs, we present pywebaudioplayer, a Python package that automates the generation of code snippets for the each of the three aforementioned web audio players. It is aimed at use-cases where audio development in Python is combined with web visualisation. Notable examples are Jupyter Notebook and WSGI-compatible web frameworks such as Flask or Django.","FILE":":Users/Hjem/Library/Application Support/Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Pauwels, Sandler - 2018 - pywebaudioplayer Bridging the gap between audio processing code in Python and attractive visualisations based.pdf:pdf","KEYWORDS":"audio player,multi-track audio,python","TYPE":"Paper"},{"key":"2018_2","type":"inproceedings","AUTHOR":"Roma, Gerard and Xambó, Anna and Green, Owen and Tremblay, Pierre Alexandre","TITLE":"A Javascript Library for Flexible Visualization of Audio Descriptors","BOOKTITLE":"Proceedings of the International Web Audio Conference","YEAR":"2018","EDITOR":"Monschke, Jan and Guttandin, Christoph and Schnell, Norbert and Jenkinson, Thomas and Schaedler, Jack","SERIES":"WAC '18","PAGES":"3--8","ADDRESS":"Berlin","MONTH":"September","PUBLISHER":"TU Berlin","ABSTRACT":"Research in audio analysis has provided a large number of ways to describe audio recordings, which can be used for enhancing their visual representation in web applications.
